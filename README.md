The motivation for this study is grounded in my Keystone project on plankton blooms in the Discovery Passage
 area. However a key piece of understanding plankton trends is understanding their interaction with the abiotic environment. 
Thus the primary goal of this study is to explore the relationship between the abiotic environment 
 of the Northern Strait of Georgia and zooplankton abundance. Specifically I want to focus on the relationships
 between sea surface temperature, wave height, and zooplankton. 
 
To accomplish this goal I develop two different analytical paths:

1.	Visual using time-series:
	First I explore the trends of sea surface temperature and wave height individually against the timeline
	 of my keystone (from 2009 to 2012)

	a.	Sea Surface temperature
	
	b.  Significant Wave Height
	
	c. Zooplankton
	
	
	

2.	Statistical analysis:
	Then I aim to compare sea surface temperature, wave height and zooplankton abundance, and run multivariate linear 
	regression for each year of data collection. Additionally, I want to explore the background of the 
	interaction between sea surface temperature and significant wave height using linear regression

	a.	Background sea surface temperature and significant wave height timeline: 
		Months

	b.	Multivariate linear regression timeline: 
		Weeks during spring

	For both of these tasks:

		i.	New dataset is created composed of mean data for time interval

		ii.	Linear model produced analyzing relationship 
 
		iii. Visual and statistical analysis of linear model is given using linear regression
