The motivation for this study is grounded in my Keystone project on plankton blooms in the Discovery Passage
 area. However before I can delve into plankton trends, I must gain a complete understanding of
 the abiotic environment. Thus the primary goal of this study is to explore the abiotic environment
 of the Northern Strait of Georgia. Specifically I want to focus on the relationship between sea surface
 temperature and wave height, since these have large affects on spring plankton blooms.

To accomplish this goal I develop two different analytical paths:

1.	First I explore the trends of sea surface temperature and wave height individually against the timeline
	 of my keystone (from 2005 to 2015)
	a.	To be finishedâ€¦

2.	Then I aim to compare sea surface temperature and wave height while additionally performing a statistical
	 analysis for the time intervals of:
	a.	Months
	b.	Years
	For each of these time intervals:
		i.	New data set is created composed of mean data for time interval
		ii.	Linear model for sea surface temperature and wave height relationship created from
			 new data set 
		iii.	Visual and statistical analysis of linear model is given using linear regression
